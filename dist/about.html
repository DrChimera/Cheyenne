            <p>
              I am just a typical guy that loves the Lord and has finally let it
              sink in that the only way to live a passionate and meaningful life
              is by becoming a better person and by giving back. I used to read
              my bible regularly and listen to self-help and motivational
              speakers. While I was doing that, it really helped me to move
              forward. However, I got out of the habit and eventually my life
              came to a place where I was content but not fulfilled.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recently I reviewed some Zig Zigglar tapes. One of the quotes he
              refers to is; “Build me a better world, " God said, I asked: "How?
              This world is so complicated and I am so small." Then God, in His
              infinite wisdom replied: “Just build a better you!” I believe that
              I have probably heard this quote before. However, this time in my
              stinking thinking, I was asking myself just this question. So,
              this time when I heard it, I got it! There is no way we can help
              others if we are not prepared to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Romans 12:2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye
              transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what
              is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
            </p>
            <p>
              What is this renewing of the mind except constant studying and
              improvement?
            </p>
            <p>
              Another quote of his; “You can have everything in life you want,
              if you will just help enough other people get what they want.” I
              believe this is probably true. However, I got the idea to try to
              modify it just a bit. You can have everything in life you need, if
              you will just help enough other people get what they need. Then I
              realized what God has been trying to tell me for over 20 years. I
              already have everything that I need, but other people are without
              what they need, Jesus! Then revised it further. If you are lucky
              enough to be saved by the blood of Jesus you have everything you
              need, so pay if forward and help others to get what they need.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mathew 22:36-40 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
              Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
              heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the
              first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou
              shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments
              hang all the law and the prophets.
            </p>
            <p>
              How can we really love our neighbor if we don’t share the
              blessings that we have received?
            </p>
            <p>
              This gave me the idea of developing The Study Site and the
              zealous.com websites. I am teaching myself web development and
              building these websites to share the wonderful news of the gospel.
              For more details about the websites see below…

              This is a project that I am developing to contain Christian study
              material and resources. God is everything. He is the reason for
              being.

              I have been really motivated and kept on track by listening to
              many self-help and motivational speakers. Many of the things they
              teach are based on biblical principles, but sometime we just don't
              see it. This is the why for another motivational and self-help
              webiste. Sometimes we just need to hear it another way.
